# docker-images
This is "holder" repository that will serve as a link to the images I've contributed to Docker Hub

You won't find any actual code or other content here.  Instead, the whole point of this repository is just this link:

https://hub.docker.com/u/fzammetti

There, you'll find all the Docker images I've contributed to the Docker Hub community.  Primarily, these are containerized versions of many of the apps from my various books, ready to pull and use.  There may eventually be other non-book images, but at least at the time of this writing, it's just the book apps.

I'm really just creating this repository so that if anyone finds me on GitHub, they'll also be able to find me on Docker Hub.

That's a wrap!
